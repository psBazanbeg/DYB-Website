# DYB-Website
We propose to create a website using that can help everyone who likes to share their books, magazines, past papers, reports, or any kind of reading resource with anyone who likes to read. It means that any generous person can donate their books as a gift to someone who wants to read them through our website. Our website is mainly targeted at people who are seeking knowledge despite economic problems, especially for the community of students.
The website allows generous people to share their unwanted old books with those who truly need them, while also encouraging poor students to succeed in their studies by reading books.
I used HTML/CSS/PHP/javaScript languages and MySQL database to implement this inovative, user-friendly website.
