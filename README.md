# DYB-Website
We propose to create a website that can help everyone who likes to share their books, magazines, past papers, reports, or any kind of reading resource with anyone who likes to read. It means that any generous person can donate their books as a gift to someone who wants to read them through our website. Our website is mainly targeted at people who are seeking knowledge despite economic problems, especially for the community of students.
